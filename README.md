# Find the fastest path with the algorithm you choose


## Done

### What can you do?

* Place an start / end position on the board.
* Place your own walls on the board (hover + mouse click).


## In the making

### What can you do?

* Make a random maze (always a random start / end position).
* Choose between multiple pathfinding algorithms.


## What can you learn from it?

* You can see the difference for every algorithm.
* You can see which pathfinding algorithm is the fastest.
