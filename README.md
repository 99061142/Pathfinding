# Pathfinding website

## How to use it

1. Add an start / end position to the board (click on an empty node on the board).
3. Choose an algorithm out of the algorithms options inside the navigation bar (click "Algorithms" to see all the options).
5. Click on the run button to see how the algorithm find the fastest path from the start to end position (the board MUST have the start and end position).


## What can you do
* Make walls on the board (move over the board when you hold the left mouse button).
* Delete walls on the board (move over the board when you hold the scroll wheel).
* Create random walls on the board (click "layouts" on the board and then "random walls" (33% chance for a wall on each node)).


## Algorithms

### Include start to end route.

* BFS
* DFS

### Not working properly (can't use this algorithm)

* Dijkstra

## NEXT UPDATES

* Fix the DFS route so that the route doesn't make a 2x2 block inside the path. (this only happens often, but when it happens it isn't the "fastest" path anymore.)
* Make the DFS code smaller.

## Note

* This website is in the starting phase, it does NOT work properly. Some things are not made and sometimes the website is not responding correctly.
* The algorithm is not optimal but it gets optimal eventually.
