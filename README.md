# Pathfinding website

## How to use it

1. Add an start / end position to the board (click on an empty node on the board).
3. Choose an algorithm out of the algorithms options inside the navigation bar (click "Algorithms" to see all the options).
5. Click on the run button to see how the algorithm find the fastest path from the start to end position (the board MUST have the start and end position).


## What can you do
* Make walls on the board ((hover) left click).
* Make weights on the board ((hover) middle click).
* Clear node on the board (left click).
* Create random walls on the board (click "layouts" on the board and then "random walls" (33% chance for a wall on each node)).


## Algorithms

### Working

* BFS
* DFS

### Algorithm not working properly

* Dijkstra (If the path has an shorter route, it sometimes doesn't pick that up and goes a longer route. (Ex: go through the weight node (50w) but doesn't go around it for 30w.))

* A* (If the path has an shorter route, it sometimes doesn't pick that up and goes a longer route. (Ex: go through the weight node (50w) but doesn't go around it for 30w.))

## Algorithm not working

* None
